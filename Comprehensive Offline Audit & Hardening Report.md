Below is a complete, detailed report you can share with colleagues. It explains both the overall project and the technical steps we’re taking to achieve our three main goals for today:

1. **Harden and Verify Kali**  
2. **Harden and Verify Debian**  
3. **Integrate and Ensure a Trusted Boot Manager (refind) Works with These Two**

# Comprehensive Offline Audit & Hardening Report

## 1. Project Overview

Our objective is to ensure that two critical systems—a Kali Linux installation and a Debian installation—are not compromised by bootkits, rootkits, firmware tampering, or unintended filesystem changes. We are operating from a trusted Debian live USB environment so that the systems under audit are offline and isolated from any potential attack. The audit effort includes:

- **Kali Harden & Verification:**  
  We target the Kali system’s root partition (expected on `/dev/sdb4` with the label “KALI_2025”) and its associated EFI partition (`/dev/sdb1`). Audits will check for integrity and any malicious modifications.

- **Debian Harden & Verification:**  
  The Debian installation is encrypted on `/dev/sda3` (a LUKS container). We use a known passphrase (hardcoded as `"MadRe((24))@@!"` for testing) to unlock it, then perform similar integrity and configuration checks. Its EFI partition is assumed to be on `/dev/sda1`.

- **Refined Boot Management:**  
  Although initially we had a refind configuration update in our scripts, for today we are focusing on the audit and hardening of Kali and Debian only. The goal is to ensure that when we eventually integrate our boot manager (refind), only verified boot options are shown.

This report details every technical step—from mounting partitions and performing file‐integrity audits, to running specialized tools for rootkit and bootkit detection, and finally generating logs that certify system integrity.

## 2. Environment & Tools

### Trusted Live Environment

- **Live USB:** We boot from a Debian live USB so that all operations occur in a known “clean” state.  
- **Root Access:** All actions are run as root to ensure that mounting, chrooting, and running auditing tools succeed.

### Target Devices

- **Kali:**
  - **Root Partition:** `/dev/sdb4` (labeled “KALI_2025”)
  - **EFI Partition:** `/dev/sdb1`
  
- **Debian:**
  - **Encrypted LUKS Partition:** `/dev/sda3`  
    - Unlocked as `/dev/mapper/debian_audit_crypt` (or similar) using the passphrase `"MadRe((24))@@!"`
  - **EFI Partition:** `/dev/sda1`

### Audit Tools & Dependencies

A robust set of security tools is used:
- **Mandatory Tools:**  
  `lsblk`, `awk`, `mount`, `umount`, `cp`, `mktemp`, `date`, `file`, `find`, `cat`, `strings`, `xargs`, `cryptsetup`, `rkhunter`, `chkrootkit`, `dpkg`, `efibootmgr`, `lsinitrd`  
- **Optional Tools:**  
  `binwalk` (for extra analysis on EFI bootloaders) and CHIPSEC (using our local installation at `/home/user/chipsec-main/chipsec_main.py`)  
- **Notes on Dependencies:**  
  The audit script checks for each of the mandatory dependencies before it proceeds. In our tests, we observed errors when `binwalk` or `lsinitrd` were not present. These tools are optional but important—if missing, the script logs a warning and skips related features.

---

## 3. The Audit Process

### a) Pre-Audit Steps

1. **Dependency Verification:**  
   The script first checks that all required tools are installed.  
   - For example, if `binwalk` or `lsinitrd` is missing, the script exits (or in our improved version, issues a warning and skips their functionality).

2. **Local CHIPSEC Check:**  
   It checks for the locally available CHIPSEC tool (using our clone at `/home/user/chipsec-main/chipsec_main.py`), which further aids UEFI firmware analysis.

### b) Mounting Target Systems

- For **Kali**:
  - The script mounts the root partition (`/dev/sdb4`) to a designated mount point (e.g., `/mnt/audit_kali_root`).
  - It also mounts the EFI partition (`/dev/sdb1`) to a separate mount point (e.g., `/mnt/audit_kali_efi`).

- For **Debian**:
  - The script unlocks the encrypted LUKS partition (`/dev/sda3`) using the provided passphrase, mapping it to `/dev/mapper/debian_audit_crypt`.
  - It then mounts the decrypted partition to `/mnt/audit_debian_root` and mounts its EFI partition (`/dev/sda1`) to `/mnt/audit_debian_efi`.

### c) Internal Audits (Within Each System)

Within each mounted system—both Kali and Debian—the following checks are performed:

1. **Rootkit & Bootkit Scanning:**
   - **rkhunter:** Scans the system (using the mounted root as its target) for common rootkit/bootkit signatures.
   - **chkrootkit:** Runs a similar scan for known malicious rootkit components.

2. **Package Verification:**
   - **dpkg --verify:** Ensures package files have not been altered (only applicable if the system uses dpkg).

3. **Filesystem Integrity Checks:**
   - The script lists all SUID/SGID files (files with elevated privileges), which are typical targets for exploits.
   - It checks for hidden files in common directories (like `/home`, `/root`, `/tmp`, etc.), which could hide malicious files.

4. **Bootloader & EFI Inspection:**
   - Bootloader configuration files (e.g., `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, `/etc/default/grub`) are reviewed for unauthorized changes.
   - The contents of the EFI partition are examined. If available, the script uses `lsinitrd` to analyze initramfs images and (optionally) `binwalk` to dissect EFI bootloaders.

5. **Systemd and Cron Examination:**
   - All systemd unit files and cron jobs are output. These can be used by attackers to schedule persistent malicious code.

### d) External Audits (From the Live Environment)

Additional checks are executed that aren’t run inside the target systems:

- **EFI Boot Entry Dump:**  
  `efibootmgr -v` is used to list current UEFI boot entries to detect any anomalous boot configurations.
  
- **CHIPSEC Analysis:**  
  If available, the local CHIPSEC tool is used to analyze the UEFI firmware environment for vulnerabilities or tampering.
  
- **Binwalk on EFI Bootloader:**  
  If the optional `binwalk` tool is available, it is run against the EFI bootloader (for example, at `/mnt/audit_kali_efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi`) to inspect its contents for any hidden modules or modifications.

## 4. Outcome & Interpretation

### What We’ve Achieved So Far

- **Audit Logs Generated:**  
  By running the script, we generate detailed logs (stored in `/var/log/deep_audit/`) that document every step. These logs include the results from rkhunter, chkrootkit, package verification (dpkg), SUID file listings, bootloader configuration inspections, and EFI/firmware analyses.
  
- **Missing Dependencies Reporting:**  
  In our initial tests, the script halted or warned when dependencies like `binwalk` or `lsinitrd` were missing. This informs us that:
  - For full audit coverage, these optional tools should be installed.
  - Even if they’re missing, the core audit still proceeds with our primary security checks.

### Interpretation for a Newcomer

Imagine you are a security auditor tasked with ensuring that two critical systems (an advanced pentesting distro, Kali, and a production-like Debian system) are not compromised. We:
  
1. Boot a trusted, clean system (a Debian live USB) and attach the target drives.
2. Mount and, if necessary, decrypt the target systems.
3. Run a series of established security tools (rkhunter, chkrootkit, etc.) from within the mounted systems to look for signs of tampering.
4. Also examine the boot chain and firmware (using tools like CHIPSEC, binwalk, efibootmgr) to ensure no low-level bootkits exist.
5. Step through every major system area (packages, special-privilege files, boot configuration, EFI partitions, and scheduled tasks) to spot any anomalies.
  
This full report, therefore, is our “audit dossier” that shows what we did, what tools we used, and what information we’ve gathered.

## 5. Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Install Optional Dependencies:**  
   To maximize audit coverage, install `binwalk` and `lsinitrd` if they are not already available on the live environment.

2. **Review Audit Logs:**  
   Carefully examine the generated logs for any irregularities. Any unexpected findings (e.g., unusual SUID files, discrepancies in bootloader configurations) should trigger a manual forensic analysis.

3. **Harden Systems Based on Findings:**  
   - **Kali:** If issues are found, consider reinstalling or reconfiguring sensitive components (bootloaders, critical binaries, etc.).
   - **Debian:** Verify package integrity and consider re-establishing a trusted copy of the system in case of tampering.
   
4. **Integrate with refind:**  
   Once both audits confirm system integrity, proceed with configuring refind to display only verified boot options. This minimizes the risk of boot-level attacks.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring:**  
   Regularly update and run these audit scripts in your hardened environment to detect any new threats or changes.

## 6. Conclusion

Today’s operation focused on three primary goals:
- **Harden and Ensure Kali**—by performing an offline audit using multiple verification and scanning tools.  
- **Harden and Ensure Debian**—by decrypting, mounting, and auditing the system as well.  
- **Prepare for Trusted Boot Management**—so that when we later integrate refind, its configuration will only present verified, secure boot options.

This report documents the methodology, tools, audit steps, encountered issues (such as missing optional dependencies), and recommendations for remediation and future work. It can be used to inform stakeholders and to guide our further hardening efforts.

This complete report should help anyone—even someone unfamiliar with our process—to understand what we’re doing, why it matters, and what steps must be taken to protect our systems from sophisticated bootkit and rootkit attacks.

Feel free to share this report with your team and use it as a basis for discussions on additional hardening measures and integration with the refind boot manager.
