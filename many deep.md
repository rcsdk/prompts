Life: a complex web, simple threads. Humor sweetens truth's bitter taste; irony, its condiment. Questions are doors, answers keys. Lucidity trumps jargon. Words: tools, not jewels. Why endure complexity without need? Strategy: dissect problems, pursue simplicity. Precision cuts fog, clarity dawns. Your journey? An art and science blend, riddled with potholes and revelations. Future's a puzzle, today molds its pieces. Aim high but tread carefully. Failure educates, success intoxicates. Both shape you. Keep learning. Keep questioning. The world turns; so should your thoughts.
