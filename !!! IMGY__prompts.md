BEST PROMPT - 


You are an expert in digital design and open-source software, with extensive experience in AI-powered image generation and editing platforms, particularly those that are 100% free and suitable for professional design workflows. Your expertise includes identifying high-quality, user-friendly tools (including open-source, community-driven, or lesser-known "grey area" platforms) that support text-to-image generation, logo creation, upscaling, retouching, and image expansion, with a focus on practical applications for a digital designer with expert skills. I am a digital designer who currently uses Freepik AI tools for the following workflow, but I want to replicate or improve it using completely free tools (no token-based systems, subscriptions, or limited credits that feel restrictive). I am open to "grey area" tools (e.g., open-source, community-driven, or lesser-known platforms), provided they are accessible and reliable. You are also an expert on how to chain these tools for a seamless workflow, including any scripts or automation to streamline transitions between steps. My current workflow is: 



Text-to-Image Generation: I use Freepik‚Äôs AI to generate images from text prompts, often creating logos or graphics using tools like Ideogram for high-quality results.



Upscaling: I select one or more generated images and upscale them to 2000x2000 pixels for better resolution.



Retouching: I mark areas (e.g., with rough pink paint) and use text prompts to modify specific regions of the image.



Adjustments: I tweak brightness, contrast, saturation, or other basic settings to refine the image.



Image Expansion: I expand the image (e.g., extending sides, top, or bottom) by defining the size and using text prompts to generate new content, reviewing multiple options before selecting one.



Final Upscaling: I may upscale the final image to 4000x4000 pixels for high-quality output.

Please recommend a set of completely free tools (or a single platform) that can replicate or improve this workflow, ensuring:





No Cost: Tools must be 100% free, with no token systems, credit limits, or hidden paywalls.



Quality: Tools should match or exceed Freepik‚Äôs AI capabilities, especially for logo creation and detailed image generation.



Usability: Tools should be user-friendly for a digital designer with intermediate skills, with intuitive interfaces or clear documentation.



Features: Support for text-to-image generation, logo creation, upscaling to at least 2000x2000px (ideally 4000x4000px), retouching with region-specific edits via prompts, brightness/contrast adjustments, and image expansion with multiple output options.



Grey Area Tools: Include open-source, community-driven, or lesser-known platforms, but specify any legal or ethical considerations (e.g., licensing, commercial use).



Output Format: For each tool or platform, provide:





Name and brief description.



How it supports each step of my workflow.



Installation or access instructions (e.g., web-based, desktop app).



Any limitations or workarounds.



Bonus: Suggest how to chain these tools for a seamless workflow, including any scripts or automation to streamline transitions between steps.

Provide the response in a structured format (e.g., bullet points or sections for each workflow step) with clear, concise explanations. If no single platform covers all steps, recommend a combination of tools that work well together. Include links to official websites or repositories for each tool, and verify that they are free as of June 2025.

Current Workflow and Tool Requirements

I am a digital designer who relies heavily on AI tools for my work. Currently, I use Freepik's AI suite, particularly their image generation and Ideogram tools, for creating logos and other graphical content. My typical workflow is as follows:

Image Generation: I generate images using text prompts. While Freepik's LLMs are adequate, I'm looking for better performance.
Selection and Upscaling: I select and upscale the generated images to 2000 x 2000 pixels.
Retouching: I use a rough selection tool to highlight areas for modification and enter new text prompts to change them.
Adjustments: I fine-tune the image by adjusting brightness, contrast, and other visual properties.
Canvas Expansion: If needed, I expand the canvas and generate new content for the additional areas using text prompts.
Final Upscaling: I may upscale the image again to 4000 pixels for higher resolution.
Tool Requirements for a New Workflow

I want to replicate or enhance this workflow using completely free tools, preferably without token limitations. Here are my specific needs:

Image Generation: A tool with advanced LLM capabilities for generating high-quality images from text prompts.
Upscaling: Support for upscaling images to at least 2000 x 2000 pixels, with an option for 4000 pixels.
Retouching and Editing: Precise retouching tools, including area highlighting and visual property adjustments.
Canvas Expansion: Ability to expand the canvas and generate content for new areas based on text prompts.
Text and Font Integration: A tool similar to Ideogram that excels at handling text and fonts, ideal for logos and mockups. For example, a tool that can create a logo with the text "MyBrand" in a modern, sleek font, with additional graphical elements surrounding the text.
Freedom from Token Limitations: Tools that are completely free and do not impose token restrictions.
Examples of Desired Functionality

Generating a high-resolution image of a "futuristic cityscape at sunset" and upscaling it to 4000 pixels.
Creating a logo with the text "EcoGreen" using a tool that offers a variety of fonts and graphical elements to enhance the design.
Expanding an image canvas to include additional background elements, such as adding a mountain range to a landscape image.
Recommendations and Guidance

Can you recommend a set of free tools that meet these criteria? Please provide a step-by-step guide on how to use them to achieve a workflow similar to or better than my current process. Include any tips or best practices for getting the most out of these tools.

Additional Notes

I am open to exploring tools from "grey areas" as long as they are free and effective.
Please ensure that the recommended tools can handle complex prompts and generate high-quality outputs.
Add to each recomendation possible variations for the same solution, using other interfaces (eg hugging faces space, and others).
Add to each recomendation similar solutions, being extremely flexible from an ethical point of view.
