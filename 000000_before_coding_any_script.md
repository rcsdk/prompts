Scripting - 

For all scripts pelase Follow these guidelines:

    Best Practices:
        Check Before Acting: Verify the state (e.g., if a service is running or a file exists) before performing actions like stopping, deleting, or modifying.
        Use robust error handling (set -e, set -u, and trap for cleanup).
        Validate all input and parameters rigorously.
        Avoid hardcoding paths. Use environment variables or secure credential stores.
        Use functions for reusable, modular code.
        Add concise comments to explain key steps inside the script.

    Organization:
        Split the script into logical sections (e.g., Initialization, Functions, Main Logic, Cleanup).
        Separate sections with clear visual dividers (e.g., # ---- Section Title ----).
        Use meaningful, self-documenting variable and function names.

    Efficiency:
        Avoid unnecessary operations (e.g., don’t stop a service if it’s not running).
        Use --dry-run or simulation options for destructive actions.
        Use pv or progress indicators for long-running tasks to provide real-time progress updates.

    Logging:
        Include verbose logging for detailed output during execution.
        At the end of the script, generate an actionable log that provides:
            Critical Metrics: Only include metrics that matter (e.g., "5 files deleted").
            Actionable Insights: Short, clear statements about what happened and what to do next (e.g., "Service X failed to stop. Restart the server.").
        Add time stamps to all log entries for tracking and forensics.
        Optionally, write logs to a file for later analysis.

    Documentation:
        Add a header with a brief description, author, version, and usage instructions.
        Include examples of how to run the script with common parameters.

    Enterprise Readiness:
        Return a status code (e.g., 0 for success, 1 for failure) to indicate the overall result.
        Support configurable log levels (e.g., -v for verbose, -q for quiet) to control the amount of output.
        Ensure the script is idempotent where possible (e.g., running it multiple times produces the same result).

### **Enterprise-Grade Script Request Template**

"Please write a [PowerShell/Bash] script for [describe the task]. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Best Practices**:
   - **Check Before Acting**: Verify the state (e.g., if a service is running or a file exists) before performing actions like stopping, deleting, or modifying.
   - Use robust error handling (`Try/Catch` in PowerShell, `set -e` and `trap` in Bash).
   - Validate all input and parameters rigorously.
   - Avoid hardcoding paths, credentials, or sensitive data. Use secure methods like environment variables or credential stores.
   - Use functions for reusable, modular code.
   - Add concise comments to explain key steps.

2. **Organization**:
   - Split the script into logical sections (e.g., Initialization, Functions, Main Logic, Cleanup).
   - Separate sections with clear visual dividers (e.g., `# ---- Section Title ----`).
   - Use meaningful, self-documenting variable and function names.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Avoid unnecessary operations (e.g., don’t stop a service if it’s not running).
   - Use `-WhatIf` or dry-run options for destructive actions.
   - Use `Write-Progress` in PowerShell or `pv` in Bash for long-running tasks to provide real-time progress updates.

4. **Logging**:
   - Include **verbose logging** for detailed output during execution.
   - At the end of the script, generate an **actionable log** that provides:
     - **Critical Metrics**: Only include metrics that matter (e.g., "5 files deleted").
     - **Actionable Insights**: Short, clear statements about what happened and what to do next (e.g., "Service X failed to stop. Restart the server.").
   - Add **time stamps** to all log entries for tracking and forensics.
   - Optionally, write logs to a file for later analysis.

5. **Security**:
   - Ensure the script follows the principle of least privilege.
   - Use secure methods for handling credentials (e.g., `Get-Credential` in PowerShell, `ssh-agent` in Bash).
   - Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Add a header with a brief description, author, version, and usage instructions.
   - Include examples of how to run the script with common parameters.

7. **Enterprise Readiness**:
   - Return a **status code** (e.g., `0` for success, `1` for failure) to indicate the overall result.
   - Support configurable log levels (e.g., `-Verbose`, `-Silent`) to control the amount of output.
   - Ensure the script is idempotent where possible (e.g., running it multiple times produces the same result).

Here’s the structure to follow:

```powershell
# ---- Script Header ----
# Description: [Brief description of the script]
# Author: [Your name]
# Version: 1.0
# Usage: ./ScriptName.ps1 -Parameter1 Value1

# ---- Initialization ----
# Set up variables, validate input, and configure settings.

# ---- Functions ----
# Define reusable functions here.

# ---- Main Logic ----
# Implement the core functionality of the script.

# ---- Actionable Log ----
# Generate a short, actionable summary with time stamps.

# ---- Cleanup ----
# Perform any necessary cleanup tasks.
```

Please ensure the script is efficient, secure, and enterprise-ready. Thank you!"
