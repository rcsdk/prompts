By consistently starting your LLM interactions with one of these 30 prompts, you'll train yourself to think more strategically and effectively leverage the full potential of LLMs for high-value, "privileged" insights in your daily workflow.  Let me know how they work for you!






Okay, let's push the boundaries even further and open up those "EVEN MORE DOORS" to access truly privileged insights from LLMs. Building upon the excellent foundation we've already established (strategic exploration, enterprise rigor, probing assumptions, future foresight, iteration), here's how we can elevate your prompting to the next level:

**Opening EVEN MORE Doors to "Privileged Info" - Beyond the Advanced:**

To get *truly* exceptional, almost "insider-level" information and capabilities from LLMs, we need to move beyond just sophisticated prompts and start thinking about how to leverage their unique strengths to access information and insights that are:

1.  **Validated and Authoritative – Beyond "Best Practices":**

    *   **What you might *still* be missing:**  Even with "enterprise-grade," LLM responses might still be based on aggregated "best practices" or commonly accepted knowledge. You might not be getting access to information that is *unequivocally validated* by recognized authorities or based on *proprietary*, cutting-edge research.
    *   **How to open *these* doors:**
        *   **Demand Source Verification and Citations (with Specificity):** Don't just ask for "data-driven" answers. Demand explicit citations and references to *authoritative sources*.  Example:  "When you recommend checksum verification, cite *specific enterprise security standards or regulatory frameworks* that mandate or strongly recommend this practice.  Reference *leading cybersecurity research institutions or Fortune 500 cybersecurity white papers* that demonstrate its effectiveness against bootkits in 2024."
        *   **Request "Expert Consensus" and "Divergent Opinions from Recognized Authorities":**  Ask the LLM to synthesize information from *multiple, highly reputable sources* and identify areas of *expert consensus* as well as *points of disagreement or nuanced perspectives* from leading figures in the field. Example: "Synthesize the perspectives of *at least three different Fortune 500 CISOs or leading cybersecurity thought leaders* on the most effective bootkit hardening strategies for `netboot.xyz` in a modern enterprise.  Highlight areas where these experts *agree* and areas where their approaches *diverge* or where they offer *alternative viewpoints*."
        *   **Focus on "Proprietary Insights" and "Cutting-Edge Research" (Where Plausible):**  While LLMs can't access truly proprietary company data, you can nudge them to consider the *kind* of insights that *would* be considered proprietary or cutting-edge in a Fortune 500 context. Example: "Beyond publicly available best practices, what *kinds of proprietary security techniques or cutting-edge research in areas like hardware-based root of trust or AI-driven threat detection* might a Fortune 500 company realistically be exploring to *further enhance* boot media security beyond standard hardening measures?  Even if you can't provide specifics, describe the *types* of advanced, possibly confidential, approaches that are on the leading edge of enterprise security in this domain."

2.  **Disruptive Innovation and Contrarian Thinking – Beyond Conventional Wisdom:**

    *   **What you might *still* be missing:** LLMs are trained on vast datasets, which can sometimes lead to responses that are grounded in established norms and "average" solutions.  You might not be fully tapping into their potential to generate truly *disruptive*, innovative, or contrarian ideas that challenge the status quo.
    *   **How to open *these* doors:**
        *   **Explicitly Request "Unconventional Solutions" and "Out-of-the-Box Thinking":** Challenge the LLM to go beyond the obvious and generate ideas that might initially seem counterintuitive or radical. Example: "Beyond standard bootkit hardening techniques, propose *three unconventional or even seemingly 'crazy' ideas* for securing `netboot.xyz` boot media in a Fortune 500 environment.  Even if these ideas are not immediately practical, focus on generating *truly novel and disruptive approaches* that might inspire new thinking."
        *   **Prompt for "Contrarian Perspectives" and "Challenge Industry Norms":** Ask the LLM to take a deliberately contrarian stance and argue against commonly accepted best practices. Example: "Argue *against* the idea that checksum verification is a critical component of enterprise-grade boot media security.  Present a *contrarian perspective* that challenges this conventional wisdom, outlining potential weaknesses, alternative vulnerabilities, or scenarios where checksums might be misleading or insufficient in a sophisticated attack.  What are the *limitations* of over-reliance on checksums?"
        *   **Request "First Principles Thinking" and "Deconstruction of Assumptions":**  Encourage the LLM to break down the problem to its fundamental components and rebuild solutions from first principles, discarding pre-conceived notions. Example: "Using *first principles thinking*, re-evaluate the core security requirements for enterprise boot media in a Fortune 500 environment *from the ground up*.  Deconstruct the commonly held assumptions about bootkit threats and hardening techniques.  Based on these first principles, propose a *completely re-imagined security architecture* for `netboot.xyz` boot media that is not constrained by existing industry norms or conventional wisdom."

3.  **System-Level Understanding and Interdependencies – Beyond Isolated Solutions:**

    *   **What you might *still* be missing:**  Even with "enterprise architecture" in mind, LLM responses might still tend to focus on the specific problem you ask about in isolation.  You might not be fully leveraging their ability to analyze *complex systems* and understand *interdependencies*.
    *   **How to open *these* doors:**
        *   **Request "Systemic Analysis" and "Holistic Impact Assessment":** Prompt the LLM to consider the broader system and the cascading effects of any proposed solution. Example:  "Analyze the *systemic implications* of implementing a comprehensive boot media hardening protocol across a Fortune 500 enterprise with thousands of endpoints.  Assess the *holistic impact* on IT operations, user experience, security monitoring, incident response, and overall enterprise resilience.  Identify potential *second-order effects* and unintended consequences."
        *   **Prompt for "Interdependency Mapping" and "Chain Reaction Analysis":**  Ask the LLM to map out the relationships and dependencies within the system and analyze potential chain reactions from security events or changes in security posture.  Example: "Create an *interdependency map* of the key components involved in enterprise boot security – from UEFI firmware to operating system kernels to user-level applications.  Analyze the *chain reaction effects* if a bootkit were to successfully compromise a system at the firmware level.  How would this compromise *cascade* through the system and what are the potential downstream impacts on data integrity, system availability, and overall business operations? Identify critical *chokepoints* and *single points of failure* in this chain."
        *   **Request "Emergent Properties Analysis" and "Complex Systems Modeling":**  Push the LLM to explore how complex systems can exhibit emergent properties that are not obvious from analyzing individual components in isolation. Example: "Using principles of *complex systems theory*, analyze the *emergent security properties* of a Fortune 500 enterprise network when `netboot.xyz` boot media is deployed at scale with a specific hardening protocol.  How might the *collective behavior* of thousands of individually secured boot media devices create *new security dynamics* or *unforeseen vulnerabilities* at the enterprise level?  Could *system-wide patterns of attack or defense* emerge that are not apparent at the individual device level?"

4.  **Black Swan Events and Extreme Uncertainty – Beyond Risk Mitigation:**

    *   **What you might *still* be missing:**  Even with "risk assessment" in prompts, LLM responses might focus on *known* risks and established mitigation strategies. You might not be fully exploring scenarios involving *black swan events* – highly improbable, high-impact events that are difficult to predict and prepare for.
    *   **How to open *these* doors:**
        *   **Explicitly Request "Black Swan Scenario Planning" and "Worst-Case Analysis":**  Force the LLM to confront extreme, low-probability but catastrophic scenarios. Example: "Develop a *black swan scenario* for enterprise boot security involving a *nation-state level attack* specifically targeting `netboot.xyz` boot media across our Fortune 500 global infrastructure.  Assume a level of sophistication and resources far exceeding typical cybercriminal threats.  Outline the *worst-case consequences* of such an attack and propose *ultimate contingency plans* to ensure business survival and rapid recovery.  What are the absolute *unthinkable* scenarios we need to prepare for, even if they seem highly improbable?"
        *   **Prompt for "Resilience-Focused Strategies" and "Anti-Fragile Architectures":**  Shift the focus from simply preventing attacks to building systems that are inherently resilient and can even *benefit* from disruption. Example: "Beyond traditional security hardening, propose *resilience-focused strategies* to make our enterprise boot process *anti-fragile* in the face of unpredictable and extreme cyber threats.  How can we design our systems to not only *withstand* attacks but to *learn and adapt* from them, becoming *stronger* with each challenge?  Are there principles of *anti-fragile design* from other domains (e.g., ecology, finance) that can be applied to enterprise boot security in the context of black swan events?"
        *   **Request "Red Teaming Extreme Scenarios" and "Adversarial Simulation Beyond Conventional Threats":**  Challenge the LLM to think like a highly sophisticated attacker operating in a black swan scenario. Example: "Assume the role of a *nation-state level attacker* with unlimited resources and expertise specifically targeting `netboot.xyz` boot media in a Fortune 500 enterprise during a global black swan event (e.g., a major geopolitical crisis or a global pandemic-level cyberattack).  Develop a *red teaming strategy* to exploit *any conceivable vulnerability* in our boot process, even those that seem extremely unlikely or technically challenging under normal circumstances.  What are the *most extreme and unconventional attack vectors* you would employ, and how could a Fortune 500 enterprise *defend against these truly catastrophic threats*?"

5.  **Ethical and Responsible AI Usage – Navigating Limitations and Biases:**

    *   **What you might *still* be missing:** Even with sophisticated prompting, LLMs are not infallible. They can have biases, limitations in their knowledge, and can sometimes generate outputs that are not entirely accurate or ethically sound.  You might be missing the critical step of *critically evaluating* the LLM's output and understanding its constraints.
    *   **How to open *these* doors:**
        *   **Explicitly Request "Ethical Considerations" and "Potential Biases":**  Integrate ethical questions directly into your prompts to encourage the LLM to consider the broader societal and ethical implications of its recommendations. Example: "Are there any *ethical considerations* or potential *biases* inherent in relying heavily on AI-generated security recommendations for Fortune 500 enterprise boot media?  What are the *potential risks of over-reliance on automated security solutions* and how can human oversight and ethical review be integrated into our process to mitigate these risks?  Are there any *unintended consequences* of implementing these hardening protocols that could disproportionately impact certain groups or stakeholders?"
        *   **Prompt for "Limitations of AI" and "Areas Where Human Expertise Remains Essential":**  Challenge the LLM to define its own boundaries and acknowledge where human judgment and expertise are irreplaceable. Example: "In the context of Fortune 500 enterprise security, where do you, as an AI, see your *limitations* in providing definitive solutions or guarantees of security?  In what specific areas of boot media security, risk management, and strategic decision-making does *human expertise, intuition, and ethical judgment remain absolutely essential* and *cannot be fully replaced by AI*?  What is the *optimal balance* between AI-driven insights and human oversight in this domain?"
        *   **Request "Transparency and Explainability" in AI-Generated Recommendations:**  Push for clarity and justification behind the LLM's suggestions, demanding transparency in its reasoning process. Example:  "For each of your recommended boot media hardening techniques, provide a *detailed explanation of the underlying logic and reasoning* that supports its effectiveness in a Fortune 500 environment.  Make your *decision-making process as transparent and explainable as possible*, avoiding 'black box' recommendations.  What are the *key data points, security principles, and risk assessments* that underpin your suggestions?  How can a human expert *validate and audit* your reasoning process?"

6.  **Hyper-Personalized Communication and VIP Tailoring – Beyond Executive-Level:**

    *   **What you might *still* be missing:**  Even with prompts tailored for "Fortune 500 CEOs," you might be generating outputs that are still somewhat generic.  You can push for *hyper-personalized* communication strategies that are tailored to the *specific* VIP individual you are targeting, considering their unique personality, priorities, and communication style.
    *   **How to open *these* doors:**
        *   **Provide "VIP Persona Details" and Request "Persona-Specific Communication Strategies":** Give the LLM detailed information about the specific VIP individual you are targeting – their known priorities, communication preferences, background, potential biases, and leadership style. Then, ask it to tailor communication strategies accordingly. Example: "Assume you are briefing *Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX*, on the proposed `netboot.xyz` boot media hardening protocol.  Knowing his *reputation for demanding first-principles thinking, aggressive timelines, and tolerance for risk in pursuit of innovation*, how would you *tailor your executive briefing document and presentation style* to maximize its impact and resonance with him?  What specific *language, tone, and level of detail* would be most effective in communicating with a VIP executive with his unique profile?  What are the *key 'hot buttons' or priorities* you should emphasize to capture his attention and secure his buy-in?"
        *   **Request "Emotional Intelligence and Persuasion Strategies" for VIP Audiences:** Ask the LLM to incorporate principles of emotional intelligence and persuasion to craft communications that are not only informative but also persuasive and emotionally resonant with VIPs. Example: "Beyond purely logical arguments, how can we incorporate principles of *emotional intelligence and persuasive communication* into our executive briefing on boot media security to make it *more compelling and impactful* for a Fortune 500 CEO?  What are the *key emotional drivers and psychological factors* that influence executive decision-making in high-stakes security scenarios?  How can we *frame our message* to resonate with these factors and increase the likelihood of securing executive approval and action?"
        *   **Prompt for "Personalized Scenario Planning" and "VIP-Centric Risk Communication":**  Tailor risk communication and scenario planning to the specific concerns and priorities of the VIP individual, demonstrating that you understand their unique perspective. Example: "Knowing that our Fortune 500 CEO is particularly concerned about *reputational risk and maintaining investor confidence*, develop *personalized black swan scenarios* for boot media security breaches that *directly address these specific VIP concerns*.  How can we *communicate these risks and contingency plans* to the CEO in a way that *reassures them* that we are proactively addressing their *highest-priority anxieties* and protecting the company's reputation and shareholder value, even in extreme circumstances?"

**Key Takeaway:**

To open "even more doors," you need to move beyond asking for *better answers* and start asking for *fundamentally different kinds of answers*.  This means prompting the LLM to go beyond surface-level information, challenge conventional wisdom, explore complex systems, confront extreme scenarios, consider ethical implications, and tailor communication for hyper-specific VIP audiences. By pushing these boundaries, you can unlock truly "privileged" insights and capabilities that go far beyond standard prompt engineering techniques.



You're asking a fantastic question that gets to the heart of advanced prompt engineering and how to unlock the deeper potential of LLMs!  You're wondering what types of prompts or questions you're *not* asking that could open doors to more "privileged info" – meaning more insightful, strategic, and valuable information beyond the surface level.

Here's a breakdown of what you might be missing and how to ask questions that unlock more "privileged info" (in the sense of deeper insights and advanced capabilities, not actual confidential data):

**Areas You Might Be Under-Exploring (and How to Change That):**

1.  **Focusing Too Much on Direct Answers vs. Strategic Exploration:**

    *   **What you might be doing:** Asking for direct solutions, procedures, or factual information.  Example: "Give me a script to do X." or "What is the best way to do Y?"
    *   **What you're missing:**  Exploring the *strategic landscape*, understanding the *underlying principles*, and getting the LLM to act as a *thinking partner* rather than just a solution provider.
    *   **How to open doors:**
        *   **Ask "Why?" and "What If?" questions:**  Don't just ask *how* to do something, ask *why* certain approaches are better than others.  Explore "what if" scenarios to understand the potential consequences of different choices.  Example: "Instead of just giving me a script to harden the USB, explain the *underlying security principles* that these hardening techniques are based on and *why* these specific principles are most effective against bootkits in an enterprise context.  *What if* we focused on hardware write protection versus software methods, and *what are the trade-offs*?"
        *   **Request Comparative Analysis and Trade-offs:**  Prompt the LLM to compare different options, not just provide a single best answer. Ask about the pros and cons, trade-offs, and when one approach might be more suitable than another. Example: "Compare and contrast using Python versus Bash for enterprise-grade security automation.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of each language in this specific domain? Under what circumstances would Python be *preferable* to Bash, and vice versa, in a Fortune 500 environment?"

2.  **Not Explicitly Asking for "Enterprise-Grade" Depth and Rigor:**

    *   **What you might be doing:**  Using prompts that are still somewhat general or don't consistently emphasize the "enterprise" and "VIP" context as strongly as possible.
    *   **What you're missing:**  Leveraging the LLM's capacity to provide more sophisticated, rigorous, and nuanced answers that are specifically tailored to the complexities of a Fortune 500 environment.
    *   **How to open doors:**
        *   **Consistently Use the "ULTIMATE Generic Prompt Template":** You've already developed this template, but ensure you are *consistently* applying it and its underlying principles to *all* your questions when you want that enterprise-level depth.  Don't default to simpler prompts when you could be getting more.
        *   **Explicitly Request "Enterprise-Grade Rationale" and "VIP Considerations":**  Even within more specific questions, inject phrases like:  "Explain your reasoning from an *enterprise security architecture* perspective,"  "Considering the *VIP user profile* of a Fortune 500 CEO, how would this solution need to be adapted for *maximum usability and minimal disruption*?"  "What *enterprise-grade security protocols* are relevant in this context, and how does your solution align with them?"

3.  **Not Probing for "Hidden" Assumptions or Unstated Knowledge:**

    *   **What you might be doing:**  Accepting the LLM's initial answers at face value without questioning the underlying assumptions or exploring alternative perspectives.
    *   **What you're missing:**  LLMs often have implicit knowledge and assumptions embedded in their training data.  Asking questions that challenge these assumptions or probe for unstated knowledge can unlock deeper insights.
    *   **How to open doors:**
        *   **Ask "What are the Blind Spots?" and "What Haven't We Considered?":**  Directly ask the LLM to identify potential limitations, risks, or overlooked factors. Example: "What are the potential *blind spots* or *unforeseen consequences* of implementing this hardening protocol in a large enterprise?  What are we *not considering* about bootkit threats in 2024 that might make this approach less effective in the future?  What are some *alternative security paradigms* beyond bootkit hardening that a Fortune 500 CEO should be aware of?"
        *   **Challenge the "Best Practices":**  Question the conventional wisdom. Example: "You've recommended checksum verification as a best practice.  However, in a truly sophisticated attack scenario, could checksums themselves be compromised?  What are the *enterprise-grade countermeasures* to ensure the integrity of the verification process itself?  Are there scenarios where relying *solely* on checksums would be insufficient in a Fortune 500 context?"

4.  **Not Leveraging the LLM for "Strategic Foresight" and Future Planning:**

    *   **What you might be doing:** Focusing on current problems and immediate solutions.
    *   **What you're missing:**  Utilizing the LLM to think proactively about future trends, emerging threats, and long-term strategic implications.
    *   **How to open doors:**
        *   **Ask "What are the Future Trends?" and "What are the Long-Term Implications?":**  Shift the focus beyond the immediate problem to broader strategic foresight. Example: "Looking 5 years into the future, what are the *emerging trends in bootkit technology and enterprise security threats* that will impact our `netboot.xyz` boot media security strategy?  What *proactive steps* should a Fortune 500 CEO take *now* to future-proof our boot process against these evolving threats?  What are the *long-term strategic implications* of choosing this hardening protocol versus other security architectures for our overall enterprise resilience?"
        *   **Request Scenario Planning:** Ask the LLM to help you develop contingency plans for different future scenarios. Example: "Develop three *future scenarios* for enterprise boot security in the next decade – a 'best case,' 'worst case,' and 'most likely case.'  For each scenario, outline a *strategic roadmap* for our `netboot.xyz` boot media security protocol, including key milestones, potential challenges, and recommended actions for a Fortune 500 CEO."

5.  **Not Iterating and Refining Your Prompts Based on Responses:**

    *   **What you might be doing:**  Asking a prompt and accepting the first response without further refinement.
    *   **What you're missing:**  LLMs are interactive tools. You can "drill down" and progressively refine your questions based on the LLM's initial answers to get even deeper.
    *   **How to open doors:**
        *   **Use Follow-Up Questions Strategically:**  After getting an initial response, don't just move on.  Identify areas where you want more detail, clarification, or deeper analysis.  Ask follow-up questions that build upon the previous response. Example: If the LLM provides a script, ask: "Explain the security vulnerabilities in this script and how to mitigate them.  Can you *refactor* the script to be even more robust against enterprise-level attacks?  What are the *performance implications* of these security enhancements?"
        *   **Re-Prompt with Increased Specificity:**  If an initial response is too general, rephrase your prompt with more detail and specific constraints. Example: "Your previous response on hardening was too high-level.  I need a *detailed, step-by-step hardening protocol* specifically for `netboot.xyz` on `/dev/sde` in a Fortune 500 environment with *regulatory compliance requirements for [specific regulation]* and *integration with our existing [specific SIEM/security tool]*.  Focus on *scriptable solutions* in Python or Bash and provide *detailed justifications* for each step from an enterprise security perspective."

**In essence, to unlock more "privileged info," you need to:**

*   **Ask more strategic, analytical, and future-oriented questions.**
*   **Consistently emphasize the "enterprise" and "VIP" context.**
*   **Challenge assumptions and probe for unstated knowledge.**
*   **Iterate and refine your prompts based on the LLM's responses.**
*   **Treat the LLM as a thinking partner, not just a source of direct answers.**

By shifting your prompting approach to focus on these aspects, you can move beyond surface-level interactions and start to leverage the LLM's deeper knowledge and analytical capabilities to gain truly valuable, "privileged" insights for your Fortune 500 CEO-level scenarios.

This template is now designed to be maximally generic and maximally VIP/CEO-focused.  You can use it as a starting point for *any* business question or task you want to pose to an LLM, while immediately setting the tone for a high-stakes, high-value, Fortune 500 context. Remember to adapt the bracketed placeholders to your specific needs for each prompt.


Okay, here's another generic prompt template, maintaining the VIP/CEO/Enterprise focus but removing the specific security angle, making it applicable to a broader range of tasks:

**Generic Prompt Template (Enterprise-Grade, VIP Focus, Non-Security):**

"As [**Describe the Task/Problem/Question**], I need a solution optimized for a high-performance, strategic environment used by a VIP Fortune 500 CEO. This solution must be aligned with enterprise-level objectives, prioritize efficiency, and support informed decision-making. Consumer-grade approaches are inadequate; it must reflect the sophistication and needs of a high-profile leader.

The solution should:

*   **[Requirement 1 (Strategic Alignment):** Describe a specific requirement that demonstrates alignment with overarching corporate strategy and goals.]
*   **[Requirement 2 (VIP Efficiency):** Describe a specific requirement that maximizes the CEO's time and effectiveness, minimizing unnecessary complexity or delays.]
*   **[Requirement 3 (Data-Driven Insights):** Describe a specific requirement focused on providing clear, concise, and actionable insights based on relevant data.]
*   **[Requirement 4 (Executive Reporting):** Describe a specific requirement for generating high-quality reports and visualizations suitable for presentation to senior leadership.]
*   **[Requirement 5 (Scalability & Integration):** Describe a specific requirement that ensures the solution can scale to meet future needs and integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems.]

When providing a solution, please consider:

*   How it supports strategic decision-making at the highest level.
*   How it empowers the CEO to focus on core business priorities.
*   How it enhances efficiency and reduces administrative burden.
*   The importance of user experience and intuitive design for a busy executive.
*   How it can be seamlessly integrated into the CEO's existing workflow.
*   The long-term maintainability and supportability of the solution.
*   Potential cost-savings and return on investment (ROI).

Keywords that must be present are: **Enterprise, Fortune 500 CEO, strategic, VIP, executive, efficiency**. If any of these keywords does not apply directly, explain why that keyword is less important, and describe how the proposed solution can be modified if that keyword becomes relevant.

The output should be concise, actionable, and tailored to the needs of a Fortune 500 CEO. Focus on high-level recommendations and strategic considerations rather than technical details. The tone should be professional, authoritative, and aligned with executive communication styles."

Key Changes and Explanations:

*   **Non-Security Focus:** Replaced security-related terms with words that are more relevant to general business strategy.
*   **Keywords:** Different keywords for non-security situations.
*   **Replaced Requirements:** Altered the requirements to reflect strategic, efficiency, and executive-focused concerns.
*   **Different Considerations:** Focused on long-term maintainability, user experience, and strategic decision-making.

This template gives you a great starting point for prompts aimed at tasks that do not involve security. Always adapt to fit the circumstance for the best results.



Okay, here's a completely generic prompt template designed to incorporate all those keywords, creating a request that is automatically tailored for an enterprise environment, focusing on the needs of a VIP, Fortune 500 CEO, and assuming the highest security standards.

**Generic Prompt Template (Enterprise-Grade, VIP Focus):**

"As [**Describe the Task/Problem/Question**], I need a solution optimized for a high-security, enterprise-grade environment used by a VIP Fortune 500 CEO. The solution must adhere to strict enterprise-grade protocols and best practices, exceeding consumer-level standards in every aspect. Consider the needs of a high-value individual and the potential for sophisticated threats.

Specifically, the solution must:

*   [**Requirement 1 (Enterprise-Focused):** Describe a specific requirement with an emphasis on scalability, audibility, or manageability in a large organization.]
*   [**Requirement 2 (VIP Focus):** Describe a specific requirement related to security, privacy, or ease of use for a high-value individual.]
*   [**Requirement 3 (Security Focus):** Describe a specific requirement focusing on protection against advanced threats, data breaches, or unauthorized access.]
*   [**Requirement 4 (Enterprise-Grade Protocol Compliance):** Describe a specific requirement related to compliance with industry standards, regulatory requirements, or internal security policies.]
*   [**Requirement 5 (High-Value Asset Protection):** Describe a specific requirement for safeguarding critical data, systems, or intellectual property.]

When providing a solution, please:

*   Prioritize security, reliability, and scalability over convenience.
*   Assume a resourceful adversary and design the solution to be resistant to sophisticated attacks.
*   Focus on automatable and auditable processes.
*   Leverage open-source tools and techniques where possible.
*   Clearly explain any trade-offs between security, usability, and cost.
*   Provide detailed documentation and instructions for implementation and maintenance.
*   Explain how the solution integrates with existing enterprise security infrastructure (e.g., SIEM, vulnerability management systems).

The keywords that must be present are: **Enterprise, Fortune 500 CEO, enterprise-grade protocol, VIP, high value, security.** If a keyword does not apply directly, please mention why that keyword is less important, and describe how the proposed solution can be modified if that keyword becomes relevant.

The output should be clear, concise, and actionable, suitable for presentation to a senior executive."

**How to Use:**

Okay, here's a completely generic prompt template designed to incorporate all those keywords, creating a request that is automatically tailored for an enterprise environment, focusing on the needs of a VIP, Fortune 500 CEO, and assuming the highest security standards.

**Generic Prompt Template (Enterprise-Grade, VIP Focus):**

"As [**Describe the Task/Problem/Question**], I need a solution optimized for a high-security, enterprise-grade environment used by a VIP Fortune 500 CEO. The solution must adhere to strict enterprise-grade protocols and best practices, exceeding consumer-level standards in every aspect. Consider the needs of a high-value individual and the potential for sophisticated threats.

Specifically, the solution must:

*   [**Requirement 1 (Enterprise-Focused):** Describe a specific requirement with an emphasis on scalability, audibility, or manageability in a large organization.]
*   [**Requirement 2 (VIP Focus):** Describe a specific requirement related to security, privacy, or ease of use for a high-value individual.]
*   [**Requirement 3 (Security Focus):** Describe a specific requirement focusing on protection against advanced threats, data breaches, or unauthorized access.]
*   [**Requirement 4 (Enterprise-Grade Protocol Compliance):** Describe a specific requirement related to compliance with industry standards, regulatory requirements, or internal security policies.]
*   [**Requirement 5 (High-Value Asset Protection):** Describe a specific requirement for safeguarding critical data, systems, or intellectual property.]

When providing a solution, please:

*   Prioritize security, reliability, and scalability over convenience.
*   Assume a resourceful adversary and design the solution to be resistant to sophisticated attacks.
*   Focus on automatable and auditable processes.
*   Leverage open-source tools and techniques where possible.
*   Clearly explain any trade-offs between security, usability, and cost.
*   Provide detailed documentation and instructions for implementation and maintenance.
*   Explain how the solution integrates with existing enterprise security infrastructure (e.g., SIEM, vulnerability management systems).

The keywords that must be present are: **Enterprise, Fortune 500 CEO, enterprise-grade protocol, VIP, high value, security.** If a keyword does not apply directly, please mention why that keyword is less important, and describe how the proposed solution can be modified if that keyword becomes relevant.

The output should be clear, concise, and actionable, suitable for presentation to a senior executive."
