This template is now designed to be maximally generic and maximally VIP/CEO-focused.  You can use it as a starting point for *any* business question or task you want to pose to an LLM, while immediately setting the tone for a high-stakes, high-value, Fortune 500 context. Remember to adapt the bracketed placeholders to your specific needs for each prompt.


Okay, here's another generic prompt template, maintaining the VIP/CEO/Enterprise focus but removing the specific security angle, making it applicable to a broader range of tasks:

**Generic Prompt Template (Enterprise-Grade, VIP Focus, Non-Security):**

"As [**Describe the Task/Problem/Question**], I need a solution optimized for a high-performance, strategic environment used by a VIP Fortune 500 CEO. This solution must be aligned with enterprise-level objectives, prioritize efficiency, and support informed decision-making. Consumer-grade approaches are inadequate; it must reflect the sophistication and needs of a high-profile leader.

The solution should:

*   **[Requirement 1 (Strategic Alignment):** Describe a specific requirement that demonstrates alignment with overarching corporate strategy and goals.]
*   **[Requirement 2 (VIP Efficiency):** Describe a specific requirement that maximizes the CEO's time and effectiveness, minimizing unnecessary complexity or delays.]
*   **[Requirement 3 (Data-Driven Insights):** Describe a specific requirement focused on providing clear, concise, and actionable insights based on relevant data.]
*   **[Requirement 4 (Executive Reporting):** Describe a specific requirement for generating high-quality reports and visualizations suitable for presentation to senior leadership.]
*   **[Requirement 5 (Scalability & Integration):** Describe a specific requirement that ensures the solution can scale to meet future needs and integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems.]

When providing a solution, please consider:

*   How it supports strategic decision-making at the highest level.
*   How it empowers the CEO to focus on core business priorities.
*   How it enhances efficiency and reduces administrative burden.
*   The importance of user experience and intuitive design for a busy executive.
*   How it can be seamlessly integrated into the CEO's existing workflow.
*   The long-term maintainability and supportability of the solution.
*   Potential cost-savings and return on investment (ROI).

Keywords that must be present are: **Enterprise, Fortune 500 CEO, strategic, VIP, executive, efficiency**. If any of these keywords does not apply directly, explain why that keyword is less important, and describe how the proposed solution can be modified if that keyword becomes relevant.

The output should be concise, actionable, and tailored to the needs of a Fortune 500 CEO. Focus on high-level recommendations and strategic considerations rather than technical details. The tone should be professional, authoritative, and aligned with executive communication styles."

Key Changes and Explanations:

*   **Non-Security Focus:** Replaced security-related terms with words that are more relevant to general business strategy.
*   **Keywords:** Different keywords for non-security situations.
*   **Replaced Requirements:** Altered the requirements to reflect strategic, efficiency, and executive-focused concerns.
*   **Different Considerations:** Focused on long-term maintainability, user experience, and strategic decision-making.

This template gives you a great starting point for prompts aimed at tasks that do not involve security. Always adapt to fit the circumstance for the best results.



Okay, here's a completely generic prompt template designed to incorporate all those keywords, creating a request that is automatically tailored for an enterprise environment, focusing on the needs of a VIP, Fortune 500 CEO, and assuming the highest security standards.

**Generic Prompt Template (Enterprise-Grade, VIP Focus):**

"As [**Describe the Task/Problem/Question**], I need a solution optimized for a high-security, enterprise-grade environment used by a VIP Fortune 500 CEO. The solution must adhere to strict enterprise-grade protocols and best practices, exceeding consumer-level standards in every aspect. Consider the needs of a high-value individual and the potential for sophisticated threats.

Specifically, the solution must:

*   [**Requirement 1 (Enterprise-Focused):** Describe a specific requirement with an emphasis on scalability, audibility, or manageability in a large organization.]
*   [**Requirement 2 (VIP Focus):** Describe a specific requirement related to security, privacy, or ease of use for a high-value individual.]
*   [**Requirement 3 (Security Focus):** Describe a specific requirement focusing on protection against advanced threats, data breaches, or unauthorized access.]
*   [**Requirement 4 (Enterprise-Grade Protocol Compliance):** Describe a specific requirement related to compliance with industry standards, regulatory requirements, or internal security policies.]
*   [**Requirement 5 (High-Value Asset Protection):** Describe a specific requirement for safeguarding critical data, systems, or intellectual property.]

When providing a solution, please:

*   Prioritize security, reliability, and scalability over convenience.
*   Assume a resourceful adversary and design the solution to be resistant to sophisticated attacks.
*   Focus on automatable and auditable processes.
*   Leverage open-source tools and techniques where possible.
*   Clearly explain any trade-offs between security, usability, and cost.
*   Provide detailed documentation and instructions for implementation and maintenance.
*   Explain how the solution integrates with existing enterprise security infrastructure (e.g., SIEM, vulnerability management systems).

The keywords that must be present are: **Enterprise, Fortune 500 CEO, enterprise-grade protocol, VIP, high value, security.** If a keyword does not apply directly, please mention why that keyword is less important, and describe how the proposed solution can be modified if that keyword becomes relevant.

The output should be clear, concise, and actionable, suitable for presentation to a senior executive."

**How to Use:**

1.  **Replace the Bracketed Placeholders:** Fill in the bracketed placeholders with the specifics of your task, problem, or question.
2.  **Tailor the Requirements:** Adjust the specific requirements to match the details of your situation.
3.  **Customize the Emphasis:** Adjust the weight given to the "VIP" aspects versus the "Enterprise" aspects based on your needs. For instance, are you more concerned about ease of use for a high-value individual or about complying with complex regulatory standards?
4.  **Run the Prompt:** Submit the completed prompt to the LLM.

**Explanation of Key Elements:**

*   **Enterprise-Grade Mindset:** The prompt establishes a high-security, enterprise-focused context from the outset.
*   **VIP Focus:** It explicitly mentions the needs of a high-value individual, prompting the LLM to consider security, privacy, and ease of use.
*   **Keywords:** The inclusion of the specified keywords acts as a trigger for the LLM to prioritize enterprise-level solutions.
*   **Emphasis on Security and Auditability:** The prompt consistently emphasizes security, reliability, and scalability, encouraging the LLM to provide solutions that are robust and auditable.
*   **Trade-off Analysis:** Asking for a discussion of trade-offs forces the LLM to consider the real-world implications of the proposed solution.
*   **Integration with Existing Infrastructure:** Prompts the LLM to consider how the solution fits into a larger enterprise ecosystem.

This template gives you a strong starting point for generating prompts that are automatically tailored for a high-security, enterprise environment. Remember to adapt the template to your specific needs and to carefully review the output of the LLM before implementing any suggested solutions. Remember that LLMs are not perfect, especially when it comes to security, so always consult with security experts to ensure that your systems are properly protected.
