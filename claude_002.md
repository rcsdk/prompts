i sent this to claude.ai - and he responded with a list. from the list - the most probable places to get real unlimited access to him  are:


i want to work with you, but as times goes by we have less and less time to talk on this free tier. and i dont have money to pay now. so i was thinking to do a scrjpt thaT generates hundreds of emails - and maintain control over which ones can talk to you during the day (calculating the tokens, or hours, or just trial an error)  - what do you think? tell me 50 other ideas to achieve my goal - and dont give me those sites like poe etc where i also have to pay - and no real access to you - only much older versions
